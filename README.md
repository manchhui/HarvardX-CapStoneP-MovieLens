# MovieLens
HarvardX DataScience Professional Certificate - Final Capstone Project

## Abstract
In this **project**, we created a movie recommendation system using a large subset of the MovieLens dataset. Exploration of the _edx_ dataset showed strong evidence of a genre effect and if used to augment the **_Regularized Movie + User Effect Model_**^[https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/large-datasets.html#recommendation-systems] could yield improvements in the accuracy of the model. This hypothesis was validated when the final model, with the addition of an regularized predicted genre effect \"*bias*\" term, yielded a residual mean squared error (**RMSE**) of **0.8575** on the _validation_ dataset.
